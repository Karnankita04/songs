                  You're insecure,  
                  
                  Don't know what for,  
                  
                  You're turning heads when you walk through the door,  
                  
                  Don't need make-up,  
                  
                  To cover up,  
                  
                  Being the way that you are is enough  
                  
                  Everyone else in the room can see it,  
                  
                  Everyone else but you  
                  
                  Baby you light up my world like nobody else,  
                  
                  The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed,  
                  
                  But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell,  
                  
                  You don't know,  
                  
                  Oh oh,  
                  
                  You don't know you're beautiful,  
                  
                  If only you saw what I can see,  
                  
                  You'll understand why I want you so desperately,  
                  
                  Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe,  
                  
                  You don't know,  
                  
                  Oh oh,  
                  
                  You don't know you're beautiful,  
                  
                  Oh oh,  
                  
                  That's what makes you beautiful  
                  
                  So c-come on,  
                  
                  You got it wrong,  
                  
                  To prove I'm right,  
                  
                  I put it in a song,  
                  
                  I don't know why,  
                  
                  You're being shy,  
                  
                  And turn away when I look into your eye eye eyes,  
                  
                  Everyone else in the room can see it,

                  Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely  

                  I have nobody for my own  
                  
                  I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely  
                  
                  I have nobody for my own  
                  
                  I am so lonely  
                  
                  Yo, this one here goes out to all my players out there, man  
                  
                  Ya know, that got that one good girl, Lord  
                  
                  That's always been there, man  
                  
                  Like, took all the bullshit  
                  
                  But then one day, she can't take it no more and decide to leave  
                  
                  Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night  
                  
                  And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side  
                  
                  Coulda sworn I was dreamin' for her  
                  
                  I was feenin' so I had to take a little ride  
                  
                  Backtracking over these few years  
                  
                  Tryin' ta figure out what I do to make it go bad  
                  
                  'Cause ever since my girl left me

                  Bahaki Sabhi Jubaan Hai

                  Hum Hai Hazaron Main

                  Ab Ki Kami Zara Hai

                  Har Chiz Khaas Hai

                  Ab Hai Jo Hai Woh

                  Sama Hai

                  Tum Rah Saki To

                  Raba Hai

                  Ab Hai Jo Hai Wo

                  Sama Hai

                  Tum Rah Sake

                  Aisi Jeet Ab

                  Chaahe Zindagi

                  Aisi Jeet Ab Chaahe

                  Sahani Humein Saja Hai

                  Hum Hai Bazaaron Ke

                  Sub Ki Nazar Yahan Hai

                  Har Chiz Raaj Hai

                  Ab Hai Jo Hai Wo

                  Sama Hai

                  Tum Rah Saki To

                  Raba Hai

                  Ab Hai Jo Hai Wo

                  Sama Hai

                  Tum Rah Sake

                  Aisi Jeet Ab Chaahe

                  Zindagi

                  I can't afford love
                  
                  I try to find a reason to pull us apart
                  
                  It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
                  
                  And I know that you're worth it
                  
                  I can't walk away, oh!
                  
                  Even though we're going through it
